      <p class='bold center'>Here's a time line of Marie Curie's life:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class='bold'>1867</span> - Born on November 7th in Warsaw as one of five children.</li>
        <li><span class='bold'>1878</span> - Death of her mother as well as her sister, three years prior, result in Maria becoming agnostic.</li>
        <li><span class='bold'>1890</span> - Started her scientific laboratory training at Museum of Industry and Agriculture.</li>
        <li><span class='bold'>1891</span> - Left Poland for France to join her sister and continue her studies at the University of Paris.</li>
        <li><span class='bold'>1895</span> - Maried Pierre Curie</li>
        <li><span class='bold'>1897</span> - Daughter Irene is born</li>
        <li><span class='bold'>1898</span> - Published a paper with her husband on the discover of polonium</li>
        <li><span class='bold'>1898</span> - December of the same year as their discovery of polonium, the couple published a paper on the discovery of radium and established the work "radioactivity". The dangerous effects of radiation exposure were not known during that time and they continued their work without any protection from the radioactive materials.</li>
        <li><span class='bold'>1900</span> - Hired at École Normale Supérieure as the first female faculty member</li>
        <li><span class='bold'>1902</span> - Visited Poland for her father's funeral. Despite Maria's desire to return to Poland and persue her research there, the fact that many schools did not hire women for such positions is the major factor that prevented her from returning.</li>
        <li><span class='bold'>1903</span> - Invited to the Royal Institute in London to deliver a speech on radioactivity. The speech was carried out by her husband, on her behalf, on account that women were not yet permitted to speak during such events</li>
        <li><span class='bold'>1903</span> - Along with Pierre Curie adn Henri Becquerel, Maria was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics</li>
        <li><span class='bold'>1904</span> - Second daughter Ève is born</li>
        <li><span class='bold'>1906</span> - A new laboratory was granted for Pierre and Marie after Pierre's request after their Nobel Prize award</li>
        <li><span class='bold'>1906</span> - Pierre is killed in an accident involving a horse-drawn carriage. The laboratory and chair in the physics department, originally intended for Pierre, is given to Marie. Amidst Marie's greif for her husband, she becomes the first female professor at the University of Paris</li>
        <li><span class='bold'>1910</span> - Marie isolated pure radium metal and establish the curie standard, which was then defined as "the quantity or mass of radium emanation in equilibrium with one gram of radium". The Curies never claimed a patent on the materials found in their studies, despite the growing business surrounding radium at that time.</li>
      </ul>
